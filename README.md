## Introduction

This folder contains data for a simulation with the MIKE 21 Flow Model FM in Conception Bay located in Newfoundland, Canada. The water level in this area is heavily influenced by semidiurnal tides from the Atlantic Ocean, and wind-driven circulation plays an important role in the area.  The domain has one open boundary to the ocean to the North.

This repository contains the setup file, input data and observation data, as well as simulation result data. The simulation result data is available in Zenodo. The data supplied in this repository covers the period from 2014-01-01 to 2022-12-31. There is a spin-up period, so it is recommended to remove the first 2 days of the result data. 


## The MIKE 21 Flow Model FM

MIKE 21 Flow Model FM is a modelling system based on a flexible mesh approach. The modelling system has been developed for applications within oceanographic, coastal and estuarine environments. The model is based on the numerical solution of the two-dimensional shallow water equations - the depth-integrated incompressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. More information can be found [in the documentation](https://manuals.mikepoweredbydhi.help/latest/Coast_and_Sea/MIKE_FM_HD_2D.pdf).

The Conception Bay mesh consists of triangular elements in a higher resolution close to the coast than on deeper waters, and for each node a depth value is assigned by interpolating the EMODnet bathymetry data. The mesh is shown in the figure below. It consists of a total of 8474 elements covering the area of approximately 900 $km^2$.

A simulation can be performed with the [MIKE modelling software](https://www.dhigroup.com/technologies/mikepoweredbydhi), while supplying the following data for driving the model:

- the water levels and current velocities on the North boundary
- wind velocities and air pressure in the domain.

This input data can be found in the [/input](/input) folder. Model parameters, e.g. bed resistance constant, can be calibrated by comparing the model simulations to observational data. 

The outputs of the model are given as a timeseries for each mesh element on the spatial domain containing the variables:
- the surface elevation,
- the u and v components of the current velocity.

This data can be found as a separate file in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14504931). Once a simulation has been run, a log file will be generated. The log-file for the benchmark simulation is found in the folder [/model](/model), and it contains information on the parameters used and the time spent on the simulation. 

Since all data, including output from a simulation, is given, it is not necessary to run the MIKE simulation. However, it is possible, since a setup file is supplied as well as all of the input data. Running the MIKE software requires a license. Read more about [obtaining a license](https://www.dhigroup.com/technologies/mikepoweredbydhi/pricing) and about [academic licensing](https://www.dhigroup.com/technologies/mikepoweredbydhi/pricing/academic-licenses). If you already have a license, read the [step-by-step guide](https://manuals.mikepoweredbydhi.help/latest/Coast_and_Sea/MIKE_FM_HD_Step_By_Step.pdf) to learn how to run simulations.

The input and output data are given as dfs files. These files can be processed using the MIKE IO Python package developed by DHI. Find more information on the data types in the [MIKE IO documentation](https://dhi.github.io/mikeio/).


## Model validation

The [ModelSkill Python package](https://dhi.github.io/modelskill/) developed at DHI can be used for validating the model outputs by comparing to observational data. 

The model is validated by comparison to observational data from a measurement station in Conception Bay and altimetry data from satellites. This is done in the notebooks code/model_validation_*.ipynb. The leftmost figure below shows the location of the measurement stations, and the rightmost figure shows the coverage of the altimetry data.

Below, the comparison between the observational data from one such measurement station and MIKE 21 is shown first followed by the comparison to the altimetry data. The production of these and many more plots is found in the notebooks code/model_validation_*.ipynb.

## Data sources

Several data sources contribute to this case. They are outlined below. 

The following changes have been made to the data:

- Sea levels in measurement stations: Data has been filtered to only include "good" or "probably good" data points according to quality flags. The coordinates of some stations have been moved into the simulation domain, since they are sometimes located so close to land (e.g. in a harbor) that the mesh is not covering it. 
- Current velocities in measurement stations: Data has been filtered to only include "good" or "probably good" data points according to quality flags. Some faulty observations have been removed manually (e.g. zero-values and outliers). The u and v components of the current velocities are calculated from the speed and directions. The data is given at different depths, so depth-averaged values have been calculated. 
- Altimetry data: Data has been filtered to only include "good" data points according to quality flags.
